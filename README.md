Project 2 Backend

## Project Description:
Mos Dicely Cantina is a web app that lets users play 3 different card games. Blackjack, matching, and war. Users can bet their chips and have their data persisted between sessions. 

## Technologies Used:
* Java
* Angular
* NodeJS
* AWS EC2
* Postman

## Features

* Users can play blackjack, war, or matching in a star-wars themed page.
* Login/Logout functionality.
* Users can bet their chips on each game.

TODO for further iterations
* Add multiplayer functionality.
* Add in a ship that users can upgrade with their chips.

## Getting Started

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
